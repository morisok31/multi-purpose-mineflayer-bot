Installing Node
In this section you will learn the basics about Javascript, Node and NPM.

Javascript, often abbreviated to JS, is a programming language designed for the web. It is what makes most interactivity on the web possible.
Node.js, often just Node, makes it possible to use Javascript outside of web browsers.

So the first thing you have to do to get started is to install Node. You can get it here.
After it is installed, open a command prompt (also known as a terminal) and then type node -v
If you have installed Node correctly, it should return a version number. If it says it can't find the command, try installing it again.

Javascript can be written in any basic text editor, but it is much easier if you use what is called an Integrated development environment(IDE)
An IDE will help you write code because it can give you suggestions, or tell you if your code has potential problems. A good IDE to start with is Visual Studio Code(VSCode)
