# How to use the bot?

To start using the bot you have to do:

```
node index.js <host> <port> <[username]> <[password]> <version>
```

If you don't know what port the server uses, you can use this website. Also the `<[username]>` and `<[password]>` fields are fully optional, you only use the `<[password]>` if you have an actual Minecraft account, and the `<[username]>` is there to determine what username you want the bot to have. If you use a "premium" Minecraft then it has to be a valid Minecraft account username, but if you do not, then you can use any username you want.

At first, it might seem hard and confusing, but you will get used to it! Once you know all the commands, you can start accually using the bot.

# How to reinstall the packets?

To reinstall the packets you have to first delete the following:

```
node_modules folder (if applicable)
package.json file
package-lock.json file
```

After you have done that, you can run the `reinstallpackets.bat` file if you are on Windows. I'm sorry for all the Mac users, you have to follow [this](https://techanzone.com/how-to-run-bat-file-on-mac/) tutorial.
